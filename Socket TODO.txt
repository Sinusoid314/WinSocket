(X, ) Move all #includes that the header depends on from the implementation file to the header file.

(X,X) Add CSocketEvent class to handle the dispatch of socket messages to event handlers.

(X,X) Error handling:
	-socketErrorStr.
	-GetSocketErrorStrFromCode() - Takes in a socket error code, and returns it's description as a string.
	-In SocketEventProc(), using WSAGETSELECTERROR() and GetSocketErrorStrFromCode() to set socketErrorStr.
	-In all CSocket methods, using WSAGetLastError() and GetSocketErrorStrFromCode() to set socketErrorStr.
	
(X,X) Get remote/local host/port

(X,X) Add sockName to CSocket and its constructors

(X,X) Keep track of socket state (disconnected, connected, listening, connecting)
	-(Disconnected) ==> [Listen() function] ==> (Listening) ==> [Accept() function] ==> (Connected)
	-(Disconnected) ==> [Connect() function] ==> (Connecting) ==> [OnConnect event] ==> (Connected)
	-(NOT Disconnected) ==> [Disconnect() function] ==> (Disconnected)
	-(NOT Disconnected) ==> [OnDisconnect event] ==>(Disconnected)

(X,X) Allow accepting incomming connections on the listening socket, instead of spawning a new socket object
	-Accept() - Establish connection on the current socket object, closing the listening socket handle
	-AcceptSpawn() - Establish connection on a new socket object, leaving the listening socket handle open
